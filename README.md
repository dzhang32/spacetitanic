# Space Titanic

The aim of this repository is to:

1. Have some fun!
2. Practice using DVC to version control data.
3. Practice using DVC to create a pipeline and track metrics for each iteration of the pipeline.
4. Gain a deeper intuition and practical understanding of XGboost algorithms.

# Steps

The sequential steps taken to address the above.

1. Setup repo with git and DVC.
2. Explore the features of the raw data.
3. Create a random forest MVP.
4. Feature engineering.
5. Feature selection.
6. Hyper parameter tuning for the random forest.
7. Create an XGboost MVP.
8. Hyper parameter tune for the XGboost.
