    "\n",
    "From the resources below, it looks like hyperparameter tuning occurs in groups for the XGboost algorithms. Groups are sets of hyperparameters that are tuned sequentially, with the order determined by the importance of the hyperparameter, with those most important tuned first. The main advantage of this tuning approach, as far as I understand, is to save on computational resources as performing an exhaustive grid search on all the hyperparameters at once would take an extremely long time.\n",
